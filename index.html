    Exercise #21

    create a new-object to hold the different pokemon types
    this new-object should have keys that hold arrays
    each key will be named after an existing pokemon 'type' (i.e grass, fire, water...)
    
    go through each pokemon-obj in the pokemon array,
        for each pokemon-obj, look at the key 'type'
            if the value of 'type' is not in new-object
                add it as a key in new-object
            else if the value of 'type' matches a 'type' in new-object
                add this pokemon obj to that array

    show the new-object once it's done
